 Analysis of the impact of Computer Vision in Basketball and python Video Analytics

## Computer Vision impact in Basketball
Computer Vision has a strong impact in gathering information
for data analytics in sports. This work shows a review of the most
common Computer Vision applications and techniques that have
been proposed in the recent years to analyze basketball games.

## Video Analytics in Basketball
The aim of this work is to extract some basic analytics starting
from a video sequence of a basketball play, using Computer Vision
techniques. The analytics extracted are:
* Run a people detector on the whole video.
Write on the output video the number of people detected
at each frame in the scene.
Qualitatively evaluate the accuracy of the detector when
reporting the results.
* Choose one person in the scene (either player or referee)
and try to track him.
Plot the trajectory on the output video.
Qualitatively evaluate the obtained results.
* Detect how many times the ball possession change.
Display the result on the output video.
